# Contributing

## Steps:

1. Open an issue even if you want to add something new because Code Nimble is a competitibe programming based editor so any new feature is not suitable for this. We need relevant features so the first think is to open an issue :)

2. If one of the core member approve your request we will start implementing the feature and work with you if you want.

3. If you already make the changes you can open a PR after the approving

## Notes: 

1. This is a light code editor so we need light features
2. Test your code before making a PR
3. Document the new code you created so we can understand in less time what you wanted to implement
